This is my solar data project, spread out a little bit over pandas, R, powerbi, and the azure workspace.  I'm here getting my feet wet.  I've made the readme after I've been working on the project for a few weeks.  

The purpose of this project is to use ADF, Azure, and PowerBI to simulate a real workflow.  I am by no means an expert on any of these things, but I have really enjoyed learning about them. 

I've learned a good deal, especially with Azure, it is a very complicated piece of software but once you set it up, it helps a lot.

I tried to get my powerBI in a format that I could upload on github but it wanted me to pay for the premium version to link it, which is a little annoying, so I am just going to add screen shots.  

It seems like it would be simple enough to add my azure stuff to the github, there's a configure repository button in ADF, but after I add my github name, it just doesn't display any repositories.
I have no idea how to explain this, will probably do some more googling on it later.

Update: It is because I have to create a collaboration branch in order for ADF to recognize it.  The joys of version control.
